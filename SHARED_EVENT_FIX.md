# Shared Event Fix - Non-Authenticated User Access

## Problem
When users shared an event, non-authenticated users were redirected to the login page instead of being able to view the EventPreviewModal. This prevented the sharing functionality from working properly for users without accounts.

## Root Cause
The main application page (`app/page.tsx`) was checking for user authentication before rendering any content, including shared event previews. This meant that:

1. Non-authenticated users visiting shared event URLs (e.g., `/?event=123`) were immediately shown the AuthPage
2. The EventPreviewModal was never displayed for non-authenticated users
3. Shared events were only viewable by logged-in users

## Solution
Modified the application to allow non-authenticated users to view shared events while maintaining security for other features:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `app/page.tsx`
- Added state management for shared events (`sharedEvent`, `isLoadingSharedEvent`)
- Modified the URL parameter handling to fetch event data when an `event` parameter is present
- Updated the non-authenticated user flow to:
  - Show loading state while fetching shared event data
  - Display EventPreviewModal over the AuthPage for shared events
  - Handle event not found scenarios gracefully
- Added shared event modal support for authenticated users as well

#### 2. Updated `lib/utils.ts`
- Simplified the `shareEvent` function to generate URLs directly without requiring a backend endpoint
- Removed dependency on `/api/events/${eventId}/share` endpoint
- Share URLs now use the format: `${window.location.origin}/?event=${eventId}`

#### 3. Leveraged Existing API
- Used the existing public `/api/events/[eventId]` endpoint which doesn't require authentication
- This endpoint was already available and working correctly

### Key Features of the Fix

#### For Non-Authenticated Users:
- Can view shared events in the EventPreviewModal
- See all event details (title, description, date, time, location, media, attendees)
- Cannot join/leave events (shows "Sign in to join this event" message)
- Can still share the event with others
- Prompted to sign in if they want to interact with the event

#### For Authenticated Users:
- All existing functionality preserved
- Can view shared events from other users
- Can join/leave shared events
- Full interaction capabilities maintained

#### Security Considerations:
- Event data is publicly readable (which is appropriate for sharing)
- User actions (join/leave) still require authentication
- No sensitive user data is exposed
- Authentication is still required for creating, editing, and deleting events

#### 4. Fixed TypeScript Interface Issues
- Updated `EventWithCreator`, `DatabaseEvent`, and `EventCardData` interfaces to include `visualStylingUrl` property
- Fixed missing property errors in event transformation functions
- Ensured type safety across all event-related components

## Testing
Created `test-shared-event.html` to verify the functionality:

1. **Create Test Event**: Creates a test event for sharing
2. **Generate Share URL**: Generates the shareable URL format
3. **Test Event Fetching**: Verifies public API access works
4. **Manual Testing**: Provides URLs for testing in incognito mode

## Usage
1. Users can now share events using the share button in EventPreviewModal or EventCard
2. Recipients can view shared events without needing to log in
3. If recipients want to join events, they'll be prompted to sign in
4. The sharing flow works seamlessly across authenticated and non-authenticated users

## URL Format
Shared event URLs follow this format:
```
https://yourapp.com/?event=EVENT_ID
```

Example:
```
https://yourapp.com/?event=cm2abc123def456
```

This fix ensures that the event sharing feature works as expected, allowing events to be shared with anyone while maintaining appropriate security boundaries.
