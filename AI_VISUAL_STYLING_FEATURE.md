# AI Visual Styling Feature

## Overview
The AI Visual Styling feature automatically analyzes event content (title, description, location, time) and generates appropriate visual styling to enhance the event invite's appearance. This creates more engaging and contextually relevant event cards and previews.

## How It Works

### 1. Content Analysis
When a user creates an event using AI generation, the system:
- Analyzes the event title, description, location, and timing
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to determine the event's theme, mood, and appropriate visual elements
- Generates styling recommendations based on the content analysis

### 2. Visual Theme Categories
The system recognizes 6 main event themes:
- **Professional**: Business meetings, conferences, workshops
- **Creative**: Art shows, music events, design workshops  
- **Social**: Casual gatherings, parties, social meetups
- **Formal**: Galas, ceremonies, award events
- **Outdoor**: Parks, hiking, beach events, sports
- **Celebration**: Birthdays, weddings, festivals

### 3. Generated Styling Elements
For each event, the AI generates:
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Theme-appropriate color combinations
- **Typography**: Font weights that match the event's formality
- **Color palette**: 3-color schemes that enhance readability
- **Layout suggestions**: Visual arrangement preferences
- **Mood description**: Human-readable explanation of the styling choices

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints
- `/api/analyze-visual-style` - Analyzes event content and returns styling recommendations
- `/api/generate-event` - Enhanced to include visual styling in event generation

### Database Schema
Added `visual_styling` column to the `events` table to store AI-generated styling as JSON.

### Components
- `AIStyledEventPreview` - Shows AI-generated styling with customization options
- `EventCard` - Displays events with AI styling and visual indicators
- `EventPreviewModal` - Enhanced to show AI styling information

### Visual Indicators
Events with AI styling display:
- "AI Styled" badges on cards and previews
- Theme information and color palettes
- Customization options for users to modify the generated styling

## User Experience

### Event Creation Flow
1. User captures media (photo/video)
2. User provides event details via AI generation
3. System analyzes content and generates visual styling
4. User sees AI-styled preview with customization options
5. User can edit styling or proceed to publish

### Customization Options
Users can modify:
- Theme selection (professional, creative, social, etc.)
- Font weight (medium, semibold, bold, extrabold)
- Color schemes within the selected theme
- Reset to original AI suggestions

### Visual Feedback
- Color palette previews with actual color swatches
- Real-time preview of styling changes
- Mood descriptions explaining the AI's choices
- Theme-appropriate gradient backgrounds

## Technical Features

### Fallback Handling
- If OpenAI API fails, system uses keyword-based analysis
- Graceful degradation to default styling if no AI styling available
- Error handling for malformed visual styling data

### Performance Optimization
- Visual styling generated during event creation (not on-demand)
- Cached styling data stored in database
- Minimal impact on event loading performance

### Responsive Design
- AI styling adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintains readability across all generated color combinations
- Consistent visual hierarchy regardless of theme

## Example Output

```json
{
  "theme": "celebration",
  "energy": "high",
  "formality": "casual",
  "mood": "joyful and festive",
  "visualElements": ["vibrant colors", "bold typography", "celebratory gradients"],
  "colorPalette": ["yellow", "orange", "pink"],
  "reasoning": "Birthday party suggests a celebratory, high-energy casual event",
  "styling": {
    "gradient": "bg-gradient-to-br from-yellow-400 to-orange-500",
    "primaryColor": "yellow",
    "font": "font-bold",
    "layout": "festive",
    "theme": "celebration"
  }
}
```
