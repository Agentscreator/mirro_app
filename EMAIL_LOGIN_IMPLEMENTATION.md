# Email Login Implementation

## Overview
Successfully updated the authentication system to use email addresses for login instead of usernames, while maintaining usernames for user profiles and registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `email` field to the `users` table with unique constraint
- **Migration**: Created `add-email-to-users.sql` for existing databases

### 2. Authentication Library Updates
- **File**: `lib/auth.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `getUserByEmail()` function to retrieve users by email
  - Updated `createUser()` function to require email parameter
  - All existing functions remain unchanged for backward compatibility

### 3. API Endpoint Updates

#### Login Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Now accepts `email` instead of `username` in request body
  - Uses `getUserByEmail()` for user lookup
  - Updated error messages to reflect email requirement

#### Register Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Now requires `email` field in addition to existing fields
  - Validates email uniqueness before creating user
  - Updated `createUser()` call to include email parameter

### 4. Frontend Updates
- **File**: `components/AuthPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added email field to form data state
  - Updated form validation to include email validation
  - For login: Shows email field only
  - For registration: Shows both email and username fields
  - Added proper email format validation

### 5. Seed Data Updates
- **File**: `app/api/seed/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added email addresses to sample users for testing

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to an existing database, run the migration:

```sql
-- Add email column to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email TEXT;

-- Add temporary unique emails for existing users
UPDATE users SET email = username || '@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL;

-- Make email not null and unique
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email);
```

## User Experience Changes

### Login Flow
- Users now log in with their email address instead of username
- Password remains the same
- More intuitive for users who are accustomed to email-based authentication

### Registration Flow
- Users must provide both email and username during registration
- Email is used for login, username is used for profile display
- Both email and username must be unique

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **New Registration**: Try registering with email, username, name, and password
2. **Email Login**: Use the registered email address to log in
3. **Validation**: Test email format validation and uniqueness constraints
4. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid emails, duplicate emails, etc.

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing user data remains intact
- Username field is preserved for profile display and social features
- Existing API endpoints for user management continue to work
- Only login mechanism has changed from username to email

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are validated for proper format
- Email uniqueness is enforced at database level
- Password hashing and verification remain unchanged
- No sensitive data is exposed in API responses
