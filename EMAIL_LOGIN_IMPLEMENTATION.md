# Email Registration Implementation

## Overview
Successfully updated the authentication system to require email addresses during registration while keeping username-based login. This provides better user data collection while maintaining the existing login experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `email` field to the `users` table with unique constraint
- **Migration**: Created `add-email-to-users.sql` for existing databases

### 2. Authentication Library Updates
- **File**: `lib/auth.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `getUserByEmail()` function to retrieve users by email
  - Updated `createUser()` function to require email parameter
  - All existing functions remain unchanged for backward compatibility

### 3. API Endpoint Updates

#### Login Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- **Changes**: No changes - still uses username and password for login

#### Register Endpoint
- **File**: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Now requires `email` field in addition to existing fields
  - Validates email uniqueness before creating user
  - Updated `createUser()` call to include email parameter

### 4. Frontend Updates
- **File**: `components/AuthPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added email field to form data state
  - Updated form validation to include email validation for registration only
  - For login: Shows username and password fields
  - For registration: Shows name, username, email, and password fields
  - Added proper email format validation for registration

### 5. Seed Data Updates
- **File**: `app/api/seed/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added email addresses to sample users for testing

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to an existing database, run the migration:

```sql
-- Add email column to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email TEXT;

-- Add temporary unique emails for existing users
UPDATE users SET email = username || '@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL;

-- Make email not null and unique
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email);
```

## User Experience Changes

### Login Flow
- Users continue to log in with their username and password
- No changes to existing login experience

### Registration Flow
- Users must now provide name, username, email, and password during registration
- Email is collected for future communication and account recovery
- Both email and username must be unique

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **New Registration**: Try registering with name, username, email, and password
2. **Username Login**: Use the registered username to log in (unchanged)
3. **Validation**: Test email format validation and uniqueness constraints during registration
4. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid emails, duplicate emails, duplicate usernames, etc.

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing user data remains intact
- Login mechanism remains unchanged (username + password)
- Username field continues to be used for login and profile display
- Existing API endpoints for user management continue to work
- Only registration process now requires email

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are validated for proper format during registration
- Email uniqueness is enforced at database level
- Password hashing and verification remain unchanged
- No sensitive data is exposed in API responses
- Email can be used for future features like password recovery
