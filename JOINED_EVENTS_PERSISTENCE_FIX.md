# Joined Events Persistence Fix

## Problem Description
When a user joins an event through a shared invite and then closes the modal (clicks X), they should remain joined to the event and it should appear in their profile. Previously, users could join events but they wouldn't see them in their profile because the profile only showed events they created, not events they joined.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Profile Page to Show Joined Events
**File: `components/ProfilePage.tsx`**
- Added `joinedEvents` state to store events the user has joined
- Added `eventViewMode` state with options: 'created', 'joined', 'all'
- Updated data fetching to include both created and joined events
- Added logic to combine and deduplicate events for 'all' view
- Added `refreshKey` prop to trigger refresh when join status changes

### 2. Enhanced Event View Toggle
**File: `components/EventViewToggle.tsx`**
- Added new toggle options: "All", "Created", "Joined"
- Updated interface to accept event view mode props
- Created segmented control UI for switching between event views
- Maintained existing "Manage" mode functionality

### 3. Updated Main App to Refresh Profile
**File: `app/page.tsx`**
- Added refresh mechanism when user joins/leaves events from shared invites
- Updated `onJoinStatusChange` to increment refresh counter
- Passed refresh key to ProfilePage to trigger data refresh

## Key Changes Made

### `components/ProfilePage.tsx`
```typescript
// Added new state for joined events and view mode
const [joinedEvents, setJoinedEvents] = useState<EventCardData[]>([])
const [eventViewMode, setEventViewMode] = useState<'created' | 'joined' | 'all'>('all')

// Enhanced data fetching to include joined events
const joinedEventsResponse = await fetch(`/api/events/joined/${user.id}`)
const joinedEventsData: DatabaseEvent[] = await joinedEventsResponse.json()

// Smart event display logic
const eventsToShow = useMemo(() => {
  switch (eventViewMode) {
    case 'created': return userEvents
    case 'joined': return joinedEvents
    case 'all': 
    default:
      // Combine and deduplicate events
      const allEvents = [...userEvents, ...joinedEvents]
      const uniqueEvents = allEvents.filter((event, index, self) => 
        index === self.findIndex(e => e.id === event.id)
      )
      return uniqueEvents.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt.getTime() - a.createdAt.getTime())
  }
}, [eventViewMode, userEvents, joinedEvents])
```

### `components/EventViewToggle.tsx`
```typescript
// Added event view mode toggle
<div className="flex items-center glass-card rounded-full p-1">
  <button onClick={() => onEventViewModeChange('all')}>All</button>
  <button onClick={() => onEventViewModeChange('created')}>Created</button>
  <button onClick={() => onEventViewModeChange('joined')}>Joined</button>
</div>
```

### `app/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Enhanced join status change handling
onJoinStatusChange={() => {
  if (selectedEventId) {
    fetchSharedEvent(selectedEventId)
  }
  // Increment refresh counter to trigger profile refresh
  setRefreshEvents(prev => prev + 1)
}}
```

## API Endpoints Used

1. **`/api/events/user/${userId}`** - Gets events created by the user
2. **`/api/events/joined/${userId}`** - Gets events the user has joined
3. **`/api/events/${eventId}/join`** - Joins/leaves an event

## User Experience Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User clicks shared event link → sees event
2. User signs up/in → sees event with join button
3. User joins event → button changes to "Leave Event"
4. User closes modal → **event disappears from their profile** ❌

### After Fix:
1. User clicks shared event link → sees event
2. User signs up/in → sees event with join button
3. User joins event → button changes to "Leave Event"
4. User closes modal → **event remains in their profile** ✅
5. User can view event in "Joined" or "All" tabs in their profile
6. User can access the event anytime from their profile

## Profile View Modes

### "All" Tab (Default)
- Shows both created and joined events
- Deduplicates events (if user created and joined same event)
- Sorted by creation date (newest first)

### "Created" Tab
- Shows only events the user created
- User can edit/delete these events in manage mode

### "Joined" Tab
- Shows only events the user has joined (but didn't create)
- User can leave these events but cannot edit/delete them

## Benefits

- ✅ **Event Persistence**: Joined events remain in user's profile after closing modal
- ✅ **Clear Organization**: Users can see all their events organized by type
- ✅ **Better UX**: No confusion about "lost" events after joining
- ✅ **Complete Context**: Users can always find events they're participating in
- ✅ **Automatic Refresh**: Profile updates immediately when join status changes
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified

1. `components/ProfilePage.tsx` - Enhanced to show joined events
2. `components/EventViewToggle.tsx` - Added event view mode toggle
3. `app/page.tsx` - Added profile refresh on join status change
4. `test-joined-events.html` - Testing utilities (new file)
5. `JOINED_EVENTS_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md` - Documentation (this file)

## Testing

Created `test-joined-events.html` to verify:
1. User's created events are fetched correctly
2. User's joined events are fetched correctly
3. Join event functionality works
4. Complete flow from join → profile persistence

The shared event invite flow now ensures complete persistence - when users join events through shared invites, those events remain accessible in their profile permanently, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
