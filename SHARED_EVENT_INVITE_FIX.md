# Shared Event Invite Flow Fix

## Problem Description
When someone shares an event invite, the recipient should be able to:
1. Click the shared link and see the event
2. Sign up/sign in if they don't have an account
3. After authentication, still see the event and be able to join it

Previously, users would lose the event context after signing in and wouldn't be able to join the event they were originally invited to.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Event Context Preservation
**File: `app/event/[eventId]/client-page.tsx`**
- Updated `handleCloseModal()` to redirect to `/?event=${eventId}` instead of just `/`
- Added `onSignUpRequest` prop to redirect to main app with event context
- This ensures the event ID is preserved in the URL when users need to authenticate

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Flow
**File: `app/page.tsx`**
- Updated `handleAuthSuccess()` to refresh shared event data after authentication
- Modified auth page rendering to preserve event context during sign-up/sign-in
- Added proper event context handling in the authentication callback

### 3. Improved Auth Page Context
**File: `components/AuthPage.tsx`**
- Added optional `sharedEventTitle` prop to show context about the event being joined
- Updated UI text to indicate "Sign in to join [Event Title]" when there's a shared event
- This provides clear context to users about why they need to authenticate

### 4. Complete Flow Implementation
The flow now works as follows:

1. **Share Event**: User shares event → generates URL `/event/[eventId]`
2. **View Shared Event**: Recipient clicks link → sees event preview (unauthenticated)
3. **Authentication Request**: User clicks "Sign Up to Join Event" → redirects to `/?event=[eventId]`
4. **Authentication**: User signs up/in with event context shown
5. **Return to Event**: After auth → automatically shows event with join option
6. **Join Event**: User can now join the event they were originally invited to

## Key Changes Made

### `app/event/[eventId]/client-page.tsx`
```typescript
// Before: Lost event context
const handleCloseModal = () => {
  window.location.href = '/'
}

// After: Preserves event context
const handleCloseModal = () => {
  window.location.href = `/?event=${eventId}`
}

// Added sign-up request handling
onSignUpRequest={() => {
  window.location.href = `/?event=${eventId}`
}}
```

### `app/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Enhanced auth success handling
const handleAuthSuccess = () => {
  const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('user')
  if (storedUser) {
    setUser(JSON.parse(storedUser))
    // Refresh shared event after authentication
    if (selectedEventId) {
      fetchSharedEvent(selectedEventId)
    }
  }
}

// Added event context to auth page
<AuthPage 
  onAuthSuccess={handleAuthSuccess}
  sharedEventTitle={sharedEvent?.title}
/>
```

### `components/AuthPage.tsx`
```typescript
// Added context-aware messaging
<p className="text-text-secondary font-normal">
  {sharedEventTitle 
    ? `${isLogin ? "Sign in" : "Create an account"} to join "${sharedEventTitle}"`
    : isLogin ? "Sign in to continue to your events" : "Join us to start creating amazing events"
  }
</p>
```

## Testing

Created `test-shared-event-flow.html` to test the complete flow:
1. Get available events
2. Generate share URLs
3. Test unauthenticated event access
4. Test complete authentication flow
5. Test event joining after authentication

## Expected User Experience

1. **Receive Invite**: User gets shared link `/event/abc-123`
2. **View Event**: Clicks link → sees event details with "Sign Up to Join Event" button
3. **Authenticate**: Clicks button → redirected to `/?event=abc-123` → sees auth form with context "Create an account to join 'Birthday Party'"
4. **Complete Auth**: Signs up/in → automatically returns to event view
5. **Join Event**: Now sees "Join Event" button → clicks → successfully joins
6. **Confirmation**: Button changes to "Leave Event" confirming successful join

## Benefits

- ✅ Event context is preserved throughout the authentication flow
- ✅ Users don't lose track of the event they were invited to
- ✅ Clear messaging about why authentication is needed
- ✅ Seamless transition from invite → auth → join
- ✅ Works for both new users (sign up) and existing users (sign in)
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality for regular app usage

## Files Modified

1. `app/event/[eventId]/client-page.tsx` - Event context preservation
2. `app/page.tsx` - Authentication flow enhancement
3. `components/AuthPage.tsx` - Context-aware messaging
4. `test-shared-event-flow.html` - Testing utilities (new file)
5. `SHARED_EVENT_INVITE_FIX.md` - Documentation (this file)

The shared event invite flow now works seamlessly, ensuring users can successfully join events after authentication without losing context.
